# --== Druidism ==--

Druidism is a web platformer made with HTML, Vanilla JS and pixel art. The game is created in MVC approach. You can play any playstyle you want, slow, fast or speed run. Thanks to the internet the game was created and learned me everything essential to create it.

## How to run it? :rocket:

You simply download the project and start local http server and launch the project in your browser.

## How to create maps? :scroll:

You can create maps with programs like Tiled and tileset that is provided into the project. Also you would need to create collision matrix, and place object with coordinates into the map.

## Features soon to be added (or possibly added :wink:)

* More game modes (eg. story mode, speed run mode)
* More levels with bigger variety
* Improving sprite sheets
* Maybe improved starting and about page (?)
* More animations
* More smooooothness
