        Druidism is a 16-bit platformer game made with HTML and Vanilla JS <span role="img" aria-label="javascript">🍦</span>.
        With the help of The Great Almighty Internet i've managed to create this game, and make it playable. In this game
        you are a druid (who would guess it lol) who is trying to finish his path in shorthest time possible, also picking
        as many mushrooms as possible. Contact me in any way you want if you have any questions, feedback highly appreciated.
        Have fun playing <span role="img" aria-label="smile">🙂</span>
