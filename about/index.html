        Druidism is a 16-bit platformer game made with Vanilla JS <span role="img" aria-label="javascript">🍦</span>.
        With the help of The Great Almighty Internet i've managed to create this game, and make it playable.
        In this game you are a druid (who would guess it lol) who is trying to finish his path in shorthest time
        possible, also picking as many mushrooms as possible. Contact me in any way you want if you have any questions.
        Have fun playing <span role="img" aria-label="smile">🙂</span>
